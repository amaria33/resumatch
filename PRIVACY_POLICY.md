**Last Updated:** November 5, 2025

---

## Overview

---

## How ResuMatch Works

All processing happens **locally in your browser**:

1. **Input Processing:** When you paste a job description and résumé, the text is processed entirely in memory within your browser tab.

2. **Local Storage:** Your settings (slider values, checkbox preferences) are saved to your browser's `localStorage` only. This data never leaves your device.

3. **Analysis:** All TF-IDF calculations, keyword matching, and scoring happen client-side using JavaScript. No data is sent to external servers.

4. **Results:** Analysis results are displayed in your browser only. Export and copy functions create local files or clipboard data without any network transmission.

---

## Network Activity

**ResuMatch makes ZERO network requests.**

You can verify this yourself:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Right-click → Inspect)
2. Go to the **Network** tab
3. Use ResuMatch to analyze a job description and résumé
4. Observe: **Zero network activity**

No API calls. No tracking pixels. No external resources loaded after installation.

---

## Data Storage

**Browser localStorage Only:**
- Settings preferences (slider values, stopword checkbox)
- Last-used inputs (job title, description, résumé) for convenience
- Stored **locally on your device only**
- Accessible only by ResuMatch
- Never synchronized or uploaded
- Can be cleared at any time via browser settings

**No Server Storage:**

## Data Sharing

## Children's Privacy

ResuMatch does not collect data from anyone, including children under 13. Since we collect no personal information, COPPA regulations do not apply, but we are committed to privacy for all users regardless of age.

---

## International Users

ResuMatch works the same everywhere because all processing is local. No data crosses borders because no data is transmitted.

GDPR, CCPA, and all international privacy regulations are automatically satisfied because we collect nothing.

We will never introduce data collection. ResuMatch is designed to be offline forever.

If we ever update this policy, we will:
1. Update the "Last Updated" date at the top
2. Notify users via extension update notes
3. Never make changes that compromise privacy

---

## Your Rights

Since we collect no data, there is no data to:

Your data stays with you, always.

---

## Transparency

**ResuMatch is auditable:**

- Inspect network activity: Chrome DevTools → Network tab
- Review localStorage: DevTools → Application → Local Storage → chrome-extension://

---

## Security

Since no data is transmitted or stored on servers:
- ✅ No risk of data breaches

Your résumé security depends only on your device security.

## Summary

**In plain English:**

Your job descriptions and résumés stay on your computer. Period.

We don't see them. We don't store them. We don't share them.

ResuMatch is just a calculator that runs in your browser—like a scientific calculator doesn't send your math problems to the manufacturer, ResuMatch doesn't send your résumé anywhere.

**100% offline. 0% tracking. Forever.**
