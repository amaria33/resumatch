## 🔄 Folder/File Naming

**Current folder:** `jobscan-lite/`

**Options:**
1. **Keep as-is** (internal name doesn't matter for users)
2. **Rename to:** `resumatch/` (if you want consistency)

**Recommendation:** Keep `jobscan-lite/` folder name for now (less disruptive), but all user-facing content says "ResuMatch"
